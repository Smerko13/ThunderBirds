tbXX.steps:

Each line in the steps file contains to parameters, the first one is seconds and the second
one is the key keypressed by the user. Basically, we are saving the moment if time and the
corresponding decision tied with it. This way we can replay the game in load mode.

tbXX.result:
In this file we are saving events:
1)The player has passed a level - represented in the file as "WIN"
2)The player failed a level - represented in the file as "LOSE"
Each event comes after the second it  happened followed by as white space.
For example, a file can look like this:
313 LOSE 250 WIN
which means we failed at the 313 second and then won at the 250 second
Note: WIN and LOSE can match diffrent events! For example, lose can mean time is over 
or it an mean losing a life by getting the small ship crashed.
